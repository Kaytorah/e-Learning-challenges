        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, <strong><em>certainly</em></strong> can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything <strong><em>at first.</em></strong><br>
        There was a time <strong>when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <strong><em>learn.</em></strong><br>
        <br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong><em>yet.</em></strong><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <strong>one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
