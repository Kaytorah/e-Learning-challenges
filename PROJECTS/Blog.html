 <h3 id="application"> <u>APPLICATION</u></h3>
  <p> I cannot exactly remember how i got to know of eHealth, but what i remember was the first time i visited the website, i randomly scrolled through every pages,<br>
  until i found the eHA academy, i read about it ad i immediately was interested, sadly at that period applications were closed, and i got the message to check<br>
  back soon for the next cohort. i checked that page atleast twice every week &#128513; so i could apply on time. Its funny how i never gave up or forget to<br>
  check the page even after two months of checking.<br></p>
  <p> Finally, one day i revisited the website and voila!!, entries for applications was open, i honestly didnt expect it, i was just checking as usual, i was shocked and<br>
  glad as well. I applied and was quite careful about the application, then i patiently waited for a response and the online assesment.</p>
 <h3 id="assesment"> <u>ASSESMENT</u></h3>
   <p> I got the email about the first phase, i was paranoid to be sincere. I immediately got into linkedIn and tried connecting with persons who had gone through the experience<br>
  in the past, and i me someome who had been part of the academy and the internship, Medina Sheriff. I asked her for tips and advice, which she did and they were really helpful,<br>
  i prepared and i did my part when the time came, i gave it my best because i really wanted to get in, i didn't check the page every week to relax at this point,<em>NO!</em> <br>
  The first assesment i scored 80%, i prayed it was good enough to be contacted for the second phase.</p>
  <p> I got the seond email, i was excited, i told Medina and she was happy for me, she encouraged me and promised to put in good words for me if she had the chance,<br>
  seeing how determined i was. On the day of the second assesment, i was yet to the link which was said to be sent over the weekend, and it was monday 3pm already.<br>
  Immediately, i got online, took a customer careline from the eHA website and called to lay my complain (i intended to bring down that line with calls if i wasn't sent a link before 5pm&#128514;).<br>
  Thankfully, the issue was rectified, and i got a link, i gave it my best shot once again, the assesment wasn't graded so i just had to sit, wait and be hopeful.</p>
    <p> Weeks passed, i went on linkedIn one day and saw a post from eHealth congratulating the new intakes into the academy, and i had not gotten an email.<br>
  I was really sad, i almost cried(but big girls dont cry &#128514;). I told Medina about it, she consoled me, told me to move on and apply for the next cohort,<br>
  hopefully i'd get in. Well, i accepted my fate and braced myself to go through the journey again.</p>
 <h3 id="admission"><u>ADMISSION</u></h3>
   <p> On 29/08/2023, exatly 4:41pm i got an email, <strong><em>i had been selected.</em></strong> oh heavens! i was so so so glad, i was surprised, i did not expect it,<br>
  i had given up, but then, here it was, i made it into the academy and here i am.</p> 
   <p> This is just the beginning of it, but so far its been interesting, although tasking as i am combining it with my final semester in the university, still no regerts,<br>
  and i am looking foward to whatever lies ahead. <em>I am ready! i am here for it!</em></p>
